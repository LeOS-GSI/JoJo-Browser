    <summary>A fork of Firefox, focused on privacy, security and freedom.</summary>
    <description>This project is an independent fork of Firefox, with the primary goals of privacy, security and user freedom.

JoJo-Browser is designed to increase protection against tracking and fingerprinting techniques, while also including a few security improvements. This is achieved through our privacy and security oriented settings and patches. JoJo-Browser also aims to remove all the telemetry, data collection and annoyances, as well as disabling anti-freedom features like DRM.

**JoJo-Browser is NOT associated with Mozilla or its products.**

## Features

- **Private Search** — Privacy-conscious search providers: [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), [Searx](https://searx.be/), [Whoogle](https://search.garudalinux.org/) and more.
